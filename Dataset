## üìÇ Dataset Description

This project uses **Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite imagery** obtained from **ResourceSat-2/2A**, sourced from **NRSC‚ÄìISRO**.

- **High-Resolution (HR) Images:** 1m resolution, covering major parts of Hyderabad region.  
- **Low-Resolution (LR) Images:** 5m resolution, downsampled versions of the same scenes.  
- **Preprocessing Steps:**  
  - Layer stacking and subsetting performed using **ERDAS Imagine**.  
  - Images cropped into **512√ó512 pixel patches** for training and testing.  
  - HR and LR images paired with identical naming conventions to simplify model training and evaluation.  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
- The **full dataset cannot be shared** due to **security and confidentiality restrictions**.  
- For demonstration purposes, this repository contains only a **small sample** of HR and LR images in the `dataset_sample/` folder.  

### Usage
If you wish to replicate this project, you can use **publicly available datasets**

You may also prepare your own HR/LR image pairs using any remote sensing dataset by applying bicubic downsampling to generate LR images.
