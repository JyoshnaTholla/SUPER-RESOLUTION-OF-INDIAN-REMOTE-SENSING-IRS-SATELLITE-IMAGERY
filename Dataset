## üìÇ Dataset Description

This project uses **Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite imagery** obtained from **ResourceSat-2/2A**, sourced from **NRSC‚ÄìISRO**.

The dataset consists of paired Medium-Resolution (MR) and High-Resolution (HR) Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite images, prepared using ERDAS Imagine for preprocessing, layer stacking, and subsetting.

Resolution:
MR images: 5 meters per pixel
HR images: 1 meter per pixel
Image Size: 512 √ó 512 pixels
Channels: 3 (RGB)
Format: PNG (converted from TIFF)
Preparation: Images were spatially aligned, normalized, and split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
Visualization: Images are NCC (Natural Colour Composite) generated using ERDAS Imagine and QGIS for enhanced interpretation.
These paired images enable effective supervised training for super-resolution tasks.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
- The **full dataset cannot be shared** due to **security and confidentiality restrictions**.  
- For demonstration purposes, this repository contains only a **small sample** of HR and LR images in the `dataset_sample/` folder.  

### Usage
If you wish to replicate this project, you can use **publicly available datasets**

You may also prepare your own HR/LR image pairs using any remote sensing dataset by applying bicubic downsampling to generate LR images.
