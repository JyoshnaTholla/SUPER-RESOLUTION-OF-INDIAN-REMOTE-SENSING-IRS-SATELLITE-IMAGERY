🏗 Model Architectures

🔹 SRCNN (Super-Resolution CNN)
3-layer CNN: feature extraction → non-linear mapping → reconstruction.
Input: bicubic-upsampled LR image → Output: HR image.
Fast and simple but limited in texture recovery.

🔹 SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN)
Generator: residual blocks + pixel shuffle upscaling.
Discriminator: CNN to classify real vs fake HR images.
Uses perceptual + adversarial loss. Produces sharper, realistic details.

🔹 ESRGAN (Enhanced SRGAN)
Generator: Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB).
Discriminator: Relativistic GAN (RaGAN).
Achieves best perceptual quality and fine details, but with higher training cost.
