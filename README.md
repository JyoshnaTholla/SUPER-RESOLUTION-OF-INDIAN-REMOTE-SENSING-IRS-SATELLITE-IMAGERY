# üõ∞Ô∏è SUPER-RESOLUTION OF INDIAN REMOTE SENSING (IRS) SATELLITE IMAGERY

A **comparative evaluation of SRCNN, SRGAN, and ESRGAN** for geospatial image super-resolution, upscaling medium-resolution (5m) to high-resolution (1m) satellite imagery.

## üìå Project Overview
Satellite imagery plays a critical role in remote sensing applications such as **land monitoring and urban planning**. However, the resolution of these images is often constrained by satellite sensor limitations, resulting in medium-resolution data that lacks the fine details necessary for accurate analysis.  

This study explores the potential of **deep learning-based super-resolution techniques** to enhance the resolution of satellite images, focusing on upscaling 5-meter MR images to 1-meter HR outputs.  

We evaluate three SR models:  
- **SRCNN** ‚Äì baseline method offering modest resolution improvements.  
- **SRGAN** ‚Äì generative adversarial framework improving image realism.  
- **ESRGAN** ‚Äì advanced architecture with residual-in-residual dense blocks, achieving superior results.  

These findings underscore the potential of advanced deep learning techniques to transform medium-resolution satellite imagery into **high-quality data**, providing substantial benefits for real-world remote sensing applications.

## üîé Notes
- _Due to limited resources, we trained the models for **80 epochs**. For better results, models (especially SRGAN) require training for days/weeks, as claimed in the original research papers._  
- _**Dataset Sources:** The dataset used in this project cannot be shared due to security reasons._
